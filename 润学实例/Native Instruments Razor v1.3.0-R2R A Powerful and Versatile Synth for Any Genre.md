If you are looking for a synth that can deliver sharp, dynamic and precise sounds, you might want to check out Native Instruments Razor v1.3.0-R2R. This synth is based on additive synthesis, which means it creates sounds by adding together sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. This allows for a wide range of sonic possibilities, from tense basses and bristling leads to atmospheric pads and glitchy effects.
